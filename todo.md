## Accomplished

- [x] **Completed:** Created `.github/workflows/bindings-ci.yml` matrixing Node.js (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) and Rust (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS).
- [x] **Completed:** Configured IDA SDK resolution and `setup-node` / `rust-toolchain` dependencies in the workflow.
- [x] **Completed:** Pushed initial implementation and a follow-up commit to fix the `-T Release` ninja target issue and remove `shell: bash` from the Windows Rust build step.
- [x] **Completed:** Diagnosed and resolved the OS-specific compilation failures on Windows and macOS.
- [x] **Completed:** Fixed the Node.js macOS/Windows compile errors (removed Node v25.2.1 hardcoding to use Node 20, added `/Zc:__cplusplus` to MSVC).
- [x] **Completed:** Fixed the Rust Windows CMake `GLOB` errors (stripped `\\?\` UNC path prefix generated by `canonicalize()`).
- [x] **Completed:** Fixed the Rust macOS build failure (mapped `-std=c++23` to `-std=c++2b` for Apple Clang 15).

## Left to do

1. Stage and commit these changes.
2. Push to GitHub and verify that the bindings CI matrix completes successfully.
