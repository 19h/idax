- Phase 14: ~100% (idapcode port complete: Sleigh-backed custom-viewer plugin added, processor-context metadata wrappers expanded (`ProcessorId`, `processor`, `address_bitness`, `is_big_endian`, `abi_name`), optional third-party submodule build wiring added for idapcode-specific dependency flow, dedicated gap audit/docs synchronization completed, bidirectional linear-view/custom-viewer address sync added with cross-function follow + scroll polling, shortcut updated to avoid common SigMaker collision, and custom-viewer backing-state update path hardened to eliminate cross-function sync crash)
- Phase 15: ~100% (Rust binding API convergence batch 1 complete across shim + Rust wrappers for address/search/analysis/entry/comment/xref/segment/storage/lumina parity APIs; batch 2 completes `ida::type` parity with function/enum factories, deep introspection, member enumeration/mutation, operand-type retrieval, type-library import/unload, and opaque-handle clone/lifecycle parity; batch 3 completes full `ida::graph` convergence including group/layout/traversal parity, graph-viewer free functions, range-based flowchart construction, and callback-bridge parity for `show_graph`; batch 4 completes `ida::ui` convergence with ask-form/custom-viewer/widget-host+metadata/show-options parity, timer callback bridge, full UI/view event subscription parity (including generic + filtered routing), and popup/rendering callback/action bridges; batch 5 completes convergence for `ida::data`/`ida::database`/`ida::name`/`ida::fixup` with typed-value transfer ABI, binary/non-binary open + file/memory DB loads, compiler/import/snapshot transfer APIs, identifier validation/sanitization, and custom-fixup registration wrappers)
- Phase 15.x: ~100% (Rust binding API convergence batch 6 complete for `ida::function` + `ida::instruction`: function update/reanalyze/frame-variable/stack-variable/register-variable parity closed with explicit register-variable transfer ABI and free helpers; instruction operand-format/struct-offset/path-introspection/register-signature/toggle/next-prev parity closed with dedicated string-array free behavior; batch 7 complete for `ida::plugin` + `ida::event`: popup attach/detach + toolbar detach exposure, typed action-context host bridges, typed event subscription callback set, generic filtered event routing bridge, and Rust `Event` payload parity fields; batch 8 complete for `ida::loader`: `LoadFlags` encode/decode transfer ABI, helper parity (`file_to_database`, `memory_to_database`, `abort_load`), and runtime input-handle wrappers for size/tell/seek/read/read-at/read-string/filename; batch 9 complete for `ida::debugger`: full request/thread/register/appcall/executor/event-subscription parity including callback-bridge ABI and Rust lifecycle-safe context management; batch 10 complete for `ida::decompiler`: event subscription parity (`maturity`/`func_printed`/`refresh_pseudocode`/`curpos`/`create_hint` + `unsubscribe`), dirty/view helpers, raw pseudocode line editing helpers, item lookup/type naming, functional visitors, decompiled raw/microcode/variables/line-map exposure, and Rust-side lifecycle-safe callback/filter context management)
- Phase 15.y: ~100% (Rust processor-domain model parity update complete in `idax/src/processor.rs`: added full `ida::processor` data-model coverage (advanced assembler directives/options, processor flags, processor metadata fields, full switch-description shape, typed analyze/result/token models), added `OutputContext` token/text builder parity helpers, added trait-level processor callback contract with C++-aligned defaults, and cleaned Rust 2024 unsafe-ops warnings in debugger via `cargo fix`; `cargo build` now completes warning-free)
- Phase 16: ~100% (Vendored ida-sdk and ida-cmake using CMake `FetchContent`; added CMake support for defaulting to fetched SDKs and isolating artifact output to local `idabin` directory instead of modifying the SDK)
- Phase 17: ~100% (Consolidated per-port gap audits into `docs/port_gap_audit_examples.md`, removed old per-port audit files, synchronized README/api/quickstart/coverage-matrix references, and pruned resolved entries from `.agents/active_work.md`)
- Phase 18: ~100% (Scenario-driven documentation remediation complete: all 10 evaluated practical-use-case docs delivered plus cross-cutting API-surface selection guide and scenario acceptance checklist mapping)

### Phase 18 TODO Action Items (Complete)

- [x] P18.0 Review 10 practical use cases and classify remediation by deliverable type and priority.
- [x] P18.1 Expand cookbook coverage for foundational workflows (cases 1, 4, 5) with complete setup/error-handling snippets.
- [x] P18.2 Add an end-to-end instruction-analysis recipe for mnemonic-at-address workflows (case 2), including database load, address lookup, decode failure handling, and operand inspection.
- [x] P18.3 Add a Rust plugin example + guide for cross-reference analysis (`refs_to`) with plugin lifecycle wiring (case 3).
- [x] P18.4 Add a call-graph traversal recipe/tutorial (case 6) showing transitive caller discovery with visited-set cycle protection and optional depth limits.
- [x] P18.5 Add an event-hooking tutorial for new-function discovery workflows (case 8) with callback signatures, subscription lifetime management, and teardown unsubscribe patterns.
- [x] P18.6 Add an advanced multi-binary signature-generation tutorial (case 7) covering pattern extraction, normalization/wildcards, similarity comparison, and output schema guidance.
- [x] P18.7 Add distributed-analysis architecture guidance (case 9) documenting single-writer IDB constraints, shard/merge patterns, and consistency-safe orchestration.
- [x] P18.8 Add safety/performance guidance (case 10) comparing safe `idax` vs raw `idax-sys`, ownership/deallocation obligations, and inconsistent-SDK-state recovery playbook.
- [x] P18.9 Run a documentation information-architecture cleanup pass that clearly separates safe Rust APIs, C++ wrapper APIs, and raw FFI surfaces to reduce cross-layer confusion.
- [x] P18.10 Extend `docs/docs_completeness_checklist.md` with scenario-based acceptance criteria requiring each practical use case to map to a runnable recipe/example/tutorial.
