- Phase 15: ~100% (Rust binding API convergence batch 1 complete across shim + Rust wrappers for address/search/analysis/entry/comment/xref/segment/storage/lumina parity APIs; batch 2 completes `ida::type` parity with function/enum factories, deep introspection, member enumeration/mutation, operand-type retrieval, type-library import/unload, and opaque-handle clone/lifecycle parity; batch 3 completes full `ida::graph` convergence including group/layout/traversal parity, graph-viewer free functions, range-based flowchart construction, and callback-bridge parity for `show_graph`; batch 4 completes `ida::ui` convergence with ask-form/custom-viewer/widget-host+metadata/show-options parity, timer callback bridge, full UI/view event subscription parity (including generic + filtered routing), and popup/rendering callback/action bridges; batch 5 completes convergence for `ida::data`/`ida::database`/`ida::name`/`ida::fixup` with typed-value transfer ABI, binary/non-binary open + file/memory DB loads, compiler/import/snapshot transfer APIs, identifier validation/sanitization, and custom-fixup registration wrappers)

- Phase 15.y: ~100% (Rust processor-domain model parity update complete in `idax/src/processor.rs`: added full `ida::processor` data-model coverage (advanced assembler directives/options, processor flags, processor metadata fields, full switch-description shape, typed analyze/result/token models), added `OutputContext` token/text builder parity helpers, added trait-level processor callback contract with C++-aligned defaults, and cleaned Rust 2024 unsafe-ops warnings in debugger via `cargo fix`; `cargo build` now completes warning-free)
- Phase 16: ~100% (Vendored ida-sdk and ida-cmake using CMake `FetchContent`; added CMake support for defaulting to fetched SDKs and isolating artifact output to local `idabin` directory instead of modifying the SDK)
- Phase 17: ~100% (Consolidated per-port gap audits into `docs/port_gap_audit_examples.md`, removed old per-port audit files, synchronized README/api/quickstart/coverage-matrix references, and pruned resolved entries from `.agents/active_work.md`)
- Phase 18: ~100% (Scenario-driven documentation remediation complete: all 10 evaluated practical-use-case docs delivered, cross-cutting API-surface selection guide and scenario acceptance checklist mapping added, cookbook/traversal docs rebalanced to C++-first default presentation, and case-10 safety/perf guidance reframed as wrapper-vs-raw-SDK)
- Phase 19: 100% (examples-to-bindings continuation: Node tool-style ports added for `idalib_dump`/`idalib_lumina`/`ida2py`; Rust standalone adaptation set expanded with procmod + plugin-style standalone flows including `ida_names_port_plugin`, `qtform_renderer_plugin`, `driverbuddy_port_plugin`, and `abyss_port_plugin`; `jbc_full_loader` rewritten to actively mutate database layout instead of just printing text; TypeScript + Cargo example checks passing; Node addon runtime linkage repaired via rebuild with correct IDA install path; runtime matrix passes for Node tool examples and expanded Rust adaptation set including JBC rows via synthetic fixture validation; ported UI-constrained `idapcode` and `lifter` analysis slices to headless examples)
- Phase 20: ~75% (real-IDA CI hardening in progress: deterministic installer resolution + macOS `IDADIR` normalization landed; Node example argv contract fixed; Windows Node import-library fallback hardened; workflow now uses Windows-native shells/runtime path propagation for Rust/Node example execution to avoid Git-Bash linker collisions and missing-DLL runtime failures)

### Phase 18 TODO Action Items (Complete)

- [x] P18.0 Review 10 practical use cases and classify remediation by deliverable type and priority.
- [x] P18.1 Expand cookbook coverage for foundational workflows (cases 1, 4, 5) with complete setup/error-handling snippets.
- [x] P18.2 Add an end-to-end instruction-analysis recipe for mnemonic-at-address workflows (case 2), including database load, address lookup, decode failure handling, and operand inspection.
- [x] P18.3 Add a Rust plugin example + guide for cross-reference analysis (`refs_to`) with plugin lifecycle wiring (case 3).
- [x] P18.4 Add a call-graph traversal recipe/tutorial (case 6) showing transitive caller discovery with visited-set cycle protection and optional depth limits.
- [x] P18.5 Add an event-hooking tutorial for new-function discovery workflows (case 8) with callback signatures, subscription lifetime management, and teardown unsubscribe patterns.
- [x] P18.6 Add an advanced multi-binary signature-generation tutorial (case 7) covering pattern extraction, normalization/wildcards, similarity comparison, and output schema guidance.
- [x] P18.7 Add distributed-analysis architecture guidance (case 9) documenting single-writer IDB constraints, shard/merge patterns, and consistency-safe orchestration.
- [x] P18.8 Add safety/performance guidance (case 10) comparing `idax` wrapper usage vs direct raw IDA SDK usage, including trade-offs and inconsistent-SDK-state recovery playbook.
- [x] P18.9 Run a documentation information-architecture cleanup pass that clearly separates safe Rust APIs, C++ wrapper APIs, and raw FFI surfaces to reduce cross-layer confusion.
- [x] P18.10 Extend `docs/docs_completeness_checklist.md` with scenario-based acceptance criteria requiring each practical use case to map to a runnable recipe/example/tutorial.

### Phase 19 TODO Action Items (Examples-to-Bindings Continuation)

- [x] P19.1 Audit current source-example inventory vs Rust/Node binding examples and classify what is headless/standalone-portable.
- [x] P19.2 Add Node standalone tool-style ports for idalib-expressible workflows (`idalib_dump_port`, `idalib_lumina_port`, `ida2py_port`).
- [x] P19.3 Expand Rust standalone adaptation examples for processor/loader workflows (`minimal_procmod`, `advanced_procmod`, `jbc_full_loader`, `jbc_full_procmod`).
- [x] P19.4 Continue porting remaining feasible Rust adaptations for plugin/procmod/loader examples that can be represented without host plugin entrypoint macros (including `idapcode_headless_port` and `lifter_headless_port`).
- [x] P19.5 Add/refresh per-example README mapping that labels each source example as direct port, adapted standalone port, or host-constrained/not-applicable.
- [x] P19.6 Run deeper runtime validations on a known-good idalib host for newly added tool/adaptation examples and capture pass/fail matrix.

### Phase 20 TODO Action Items (Real-IDA CI Hardening)

- [x] P20.1 Fix Node bindings workflow example invocation to pass only expected CLI arguments.
- [x] P20.2 Avoid Windows debug CRT link failures in Rust bindings workflow by building/running examples in `--release`.
- [x] P20.3 Harden Node Windows linkage discovery so MSVC import libs are resolved from `IDASDK` even when `IDADIR` is present.
- [x] P20.4 Fix Windows workflow shell/runtime routing so Rust uses MSVC `link.exe` (not `/usr/bin/link`) and examples resolve IDA DLLs via `PATH`.
- [~] P20.5 Re-run `Bindings CI` matrix and close residual runtime/linking regressions (current focus: Windows Rust CRT/runtime-library alignment after merged `idax_shim_merged.lib` propagation proved effective; force MSVC `/MD` consistency in `idax-sys` CMake build while keeping temporary full Windows Node example gating until headless runtime flakes are diagnosable).
