## 16) In-Progress and Immediate Next Actions

> **Tracking Policy:** This list tracks *active*, *queued*, and *blocked* work only. Once an item reaches completion, record its evidence in the Progress Ledger and, when applicable, the Knowledge Base, then remove it from this file in the same closure update. Historical or retired entries are prohibited.

### 1. CI & Validation Infrastructure

- **1.1. GitHub Actions Matrix (Default Path)**
  - 1.1.1. **Action:** Keep `.github/workflows/validation-matrix.yml` as default cross-OS evidence path.
  - 1.1.2. **Scope:** `compile-only` + `unit` on every release-significant change.
  - 1.1.3. **Status:** Active / ongoing.

- **1.2. Host-Specific Hardening**
  - 1.2.1. **Action:** Continue host-specific hardening runs where licenses/toolchains permit.
  - **1.2.2. Linux**
    - 1.2.2.1. Keep Clang 19 as baseline evidence.
    - 1.2.2.2. Execute `full` rows with runtime installs when available.
  - **1.2.3. Windows**
    - 1.2.3.1. Execute `full` rows with runtime installs when available.
  - 1.2.4. **Status:** Ongoing / license-gated.

### 2. JBC & Processor Module Parity

- **2.1. Validation Continuation**
  - 2.1.1. **Action:** Continue validating JBC parity APIs against additional real-world procmod ports.
  - 2.1.2. **Scope:** Expand typed analyze/output metadata only when concrete migration evidence requires deeper fidelity.
  - 2.1.3. **Status:** Ongoing / evidence-driven.

---

### 3. Lumina Hardening

- **3.1. Beyond Pull/Push Baseline**
  - 3.1.1. **Action:** Keep hardening `ida::lumina` behavior beyond now-passing pull/push smoke baseline.
  - 3.1.2. **Focus:** Close/disconnect semantics once portable runtime symbols are confirmed.
  - 3.1.3. **Blocker:** Runtime dylibs do not export `close_server_connection2`/`close_server_connections`.
  - 3.1.4. **Status:** Blocked on runtime symbol availability.

---

### 4. Appcall Runtime Evidence

- **4.1. Debugger-Capable Host Execution**
  - 4.1.1. **Action:** Execute `docs/appcall_runtime_validation.md` on a debugger-capable host.
  - **4.1.2. Current Block State**
    - 4.1.2.1. Backend loads successfully.
    - 4.1.2.2. `start_process` returns `0` + still `NoProcess`.
    - 4.1.2.3. `request_start` -> no-process.
    - 4.1.2.4. `attach_process` returns `-1` + still `NoProcess`.
    - 4.1.2.5. `request_attach` -> no-process.
  - 4.1.3. **Goal:** Convert block into pass evidence.
  - 4.1.4. **Follow-Up:** Expand Appcall argument/return kind coverage only where concrete ports require additional fidelity.
  - 4.1.5. **Status:** Blocked on debugger-capable host.

### 6. ida-cdump Parity Closure (Phase 22)

- **6.1. Host Evidence Queue**
  - 6.1.1. **Action:** Collect interactive host evidence for the remaining P22 UI/runtime gates documented in `docs/codedump_parity_tasks.md`.
  - 6.1.2. **Modal typed-form evidence:** Run `IDAX_RUN_MODAL_FORMS=1` in an interactive IDA UI host, accept the codedump-shaped dialog, and verify the captured log with `scripts/check_codedump_parity_evidence_log.sh <log> modal`.
  - 6.1.3. **Clipboard evidence:** Run `IDAX_RUN_QT_CLIPBOARD=1` in an IDA UI host with either an IDA-compatible Qt clipboard backend or a working external clipboard command, then verify with `scripts/check_codedump_parity_evidence_log.sh <log> qt-clipboard`.
  - 6.1.4. **Blocker:** Requires an interactive IDA UI host; Qt clipboard mode also requires either a namespaced `QT_NAMESPACE=QT` Qt package or usable host clipboard command access.
  - 6.1.5. **Status:** In progress / host-gated.

### 10. Loadable Processor-Module ABI Closure (Phase 58)

- **10.1. P58.4 validation and closure**
  - 10.1.1. **Action:** Prove the exported descriptor and callback path against the pinned SDK and an IDA 9.4 host; run complete regression, privacy, exact staged review, push, and same-update active-work removal.
  - 10.1.2. **Local blocker:** The installed 9.4 runtime reaches license validation, but the workstation HCLI session is expired; no local credential is available to refresh it.
  - 10.1.3. **Impact:** Local IDA batch load/analyze/output evidence cannot complete on this host. Exact-SDK compilation, symbol inspection, offline contract tests, and cross-language tests remain available.
  - 10.1.4. **Mitigation/status:** Active. The validation matrix now runs the same runtime smoke after its authenticated active-named-license installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows; push and live CI are the reopening probe.
  - 10.1.5. **History privacy status:** Active. The current tree is clean, but 249 sensitive blobs remain reachable from the pre-rewrite `origin/master`. Commit the exact candidate, rewrite project-owned reachable history with fixed-width substitutions in an isolated mirror, prove an unchanged tip tree plus `git fsck` and zero-hit history scan, and push only the rewritten ref (F521; KB 35.174).
  - 10.1.6. **CI status:** Rewritten owned refs and zero-hit history scans pass. Validation run 29470851825 proves Linux IDA 9.4 procmod analyze/output dispatch, then rejects the external downloaded installer because its acquisition root was not ignored. The bounded F524 ignore fix and replacement cross-platform runs are active; `master` promotion and same-update section removal remain pending.
