**Total: 16/16 CTest targets pass**

## Scenario coverage highlights

- Address/data/database flows
- Name/comment/xref/search behaviors
- Segment/function/type/fixup traversals and mutations
- Instruction decode/render/operand representation
- Loader base class, helper functions, value types
- Processor base class, metadata, switch detection types, optional callbacks
- Plugin action types and handler execution
- Loader/procmod/plugin example addon builds
- Debugger event subscription lifecycle (all 11 event types)
- UI event subscriptions (5 event types + ScopedSubscription RAII)
- Graph object operations (node/edge/group/path/clear/move semantics)
- Flowchart generation from function addresses
- Event typed subscriptions + generic routing + filtered routing
- Decompiler pseudocode/ctree/comment/address mapping scenarios
- Decompiler edge cases: multi-function, variable classification, ctree diversity, rename roundtrip
- Storage alt/sup/hash/blob operations
- Event stress: concurrent subscribers, rapid sub/unsub, multi-event fan-out
- Performance benchmarks: decode throughput, function iteration, pattern search, decompile latency

## Platform/compiler matrix (current pass)

- macOS arm64, AppleClang 17, RelWithDebInfo profile: pass (16/16)
- macOS arm64, AppleClang 17, Release profile: pass (16/16)

Planned Linux/Windows compiler rows and command profiles are tracked in
