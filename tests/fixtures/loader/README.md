# Loader-Focused Fixtures

Current baseline fixture set:

- Reuse `../simple_appcall_linux64` for binary transfer tests (`file_to_database`, `memory_to_database`).

Planned additions:

- archive/container sample for nested extraction flows
- packed/encoded segment sample for patchability edge cases
